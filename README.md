# Mini Recycle Bin

This program is a utility for Windows. It is a small recycle bin icon in the system tray, with the following functionality described below. This utility is intended for those who do not like having the Recycle Bin icon always on the desktop and want to get rid of it but have no alternative.

## Installation

Go to the releases in this repository and download the zip archive. After that, unzip it to a convenient location and select “Register this program for restart” in the properties of the exe file.

## More about the Program

The program has the following functionality:
- When you double-click on the icon, the Recycle Bin itself opens.
- Right-click on the icon to open the context menu, which has the following functions:

  > `Clear` - clears the recycle bin (you can determine whether a file is in the recycle bin by looking at the icon, since the utility supports changing the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle bin).

  > `Change Theme` - changes the icon theme (if you downloaded this utility from the release page of this repository, you may have noticed that it contains the “Icons” folder, which includes icons straight from Windows 7! So when you click the button to change the theme, you will see the recycle bin icon from Windows 7).

  > `Exit` - Exit the program.

Also, as mentioned above, the utility changes the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle bin (i.e., if you have some files or folders in the recycle bin, the recycle bin icon will be displayed as full; otherwise, it will be empty).

# Mini Recycle Bin

This program is a utility for Windows. It is a small recycle garbage can icon in the icon tray, with a small functionality, which is described below. This utility is intended for those who do not like that Recycle Bin icon is always on the desktop and want to get rid of it, but there is no alternative. 

## Installation

Go to the releases in this repository and download the zip archive. After that unzip it to a convenient place and select “Register this program for restart” in the properties of the exe file

## More about program

The program has the following functionality:
When you click on the icon twice, the Recycle Bin itself opens
Right-click on the icon to open the context menu, which has the following functions:

> `Clear` - clears the recycle garbage can (you can determine whether a file is in the recycle garbage can by looking at the icon, since the utility supports changing the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle garbage can).

> `Change Theme` - changes the icon theme (if you downloaded this utility from the release page of this repository, you may have noticed that it contains the “Icons” folder, which contains icons straight from Windows 7! So when you click the button to change the theme, you will see the recycle garbage can icon from Windows 7)

> `Exit` - Exit the program

Also, as you can read above, the utility changes the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle garbage can (i.e. if you have some files or folders in the recycle garbage can, the recycle garbage can icon will be displayed full, otherwise it will be empty).

# Mini Recycle Bin

This utility was made for personal use, so you can change it as you like.

This program is a utility for Windows. It is a small recycle bin icon in the system tray, with the following functionality described below. This utility is intended for those who do not like having the Recycle Bin icon always on the desktop and want to get rid of it but have no alternative.

## Installation

Go to the releases in this repository and download the zip archive. After that, unpack it to a convenient place and, if desired, you can add the program shortcut (which is in the archive) to the folder with programs for autostart
## More about the Program

The program has the following functionality:
- When you double-click on the icon, the Recycle Bin itself opens.
- Right-click on the icon to open the context menu, which has the following functions:

  > `Clear` - clears the recycle bin (you can determine whether a file is in the recycle bin by looking at the icon, since the utility supports changing the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle bin).

  > `Properties` - is a window that contains a combobox with a choice of icon theme (Stable version or Windows 7). If desired, you can replace the icons with your own and instead of the Windows 7 icon there will be your icon (just keep in mind that the same icon name is required as in the code or in the icon name in the release).

  > `Exit` - Exit the program.

Also, as mentioned above, the utility changes the icon depending on the fullness of the recycle bin (i.e., if you have some files or folders in the recycle bin, the recycle bin icon will be displayed as full; otherwise, it will be empty).
